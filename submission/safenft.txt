Quill Audit CTF 
SafeNFT

explanation: 

the following function can make arbritary calls:

function _checkOnERC721Received()


steps:
1. construct contract conforming to IERC721Receiver by implementing onERC721Receive
2. call buyNFT to set canClaim[msg.sender] = true
2. onERC721Received calls back into safeNFT contract, claiming multiple times
3. transfer from attack contract to eoa address
