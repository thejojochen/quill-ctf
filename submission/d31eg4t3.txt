Quill Audit CTF 
D31eg4t3

explanation: 

delegate calls are made in the context of the sender, including storage
storage changes made in the delegatee contract are published accordingly in the calling contract

steps:
1. construct attack contract which calls D31eg4t3.hackMe, which makes a callback to the attack contract's mutateStorage() function
2. modify source contract to more easily query public storage (alternatively, load storage directly)
3. check to see if the storage has changed as a result of the delegate call

mitigation: change require statement to:

ensure any delegate calls are made to trusted contracts*
