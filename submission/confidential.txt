Quill Audit CTF 
Confidential 


explanation: 

variables marked 'private' or 'internal' are accessible if their storage slot is known

steps:
1. create a fork of goerli with the state from the latest block
2. use foundry's cheatcode 'load' which can load storage from any address at any slot
3. reconstruct hash and check hash

poc (using foundry): https://github.com/thejojochen/quill-ctf

foundry output:
Running 1 test for test/ConfidentialSolution.t.sol:ConfidentialSolution
[PASS] testSolve() (gas: 29168)
Logs:
  success

mitigation: do not store confidential data on chain
