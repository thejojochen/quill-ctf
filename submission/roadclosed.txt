Quill Audit CTF 
Road Closed

explanation: 

the following functions lack access control: 

function addToWhitelist(address addr) public

steps:
1. call addToWhitelist() from an external account (to bypass the !isContract() check) to change whitelistedMinters[YOUR_ADDRESS] to true
2. call changeOnwer() from the same EOA, first check will pass due to first step
3. call pwn() from the same EOA, third check will pass due to step 2

poc (using foundry): 

foundry output:
Running 2 tests for test/RoadBlockSolution.t.sol:RoadBlockSolution
[PASS] testInitialConditions() (gas: 11633)
[PASS] testSolution() (gas: 40103)
Test result: ok. 2 passed; 0 failed; finished in 1.92ms

mitigation: ensure only the owner can call addToWhitelist(address addr):

1. require(isOwner());
2. if msg.sender != owner revert notTheOwner();
